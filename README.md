# Mister's personal nix config

### Doom Emacs note
By searching, installing doom emacs in a declarative way seems a bit akward. To avoid that, I just symlink the doom config into .config using home manager, but the doom install should be made imperatively.
For effective purposes, just download doom and run `doom sync`.
